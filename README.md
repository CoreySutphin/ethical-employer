This is a website in the making built using **React** and **Node**.  It is meant to be a way for people seeking employment to evaluate a potential company based on their impact and role in society.  Users will leave reviews similar to services like glassdoor.com but other metrics such as inclusiveness and work/life balance will be taken into account.  In addition the company's Twitter feed(or other social media prescence) will be analyzed and presented on their page to help potential employees see the public perception of the company.  *The aim is to present a more human and understandable portrayal of a company that sites like glassdoor do not currently give.*
